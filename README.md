# Rooms

An app written in [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) to act as a base for any app involving players joining 
rooms/games/channels/lobbies. Mostly just a test app to see how Meteor is and if I should write more in it. 
So far, so good. 

## Features

* Create a room with a name
* First player in the room is the host
* Other players join the room and create a player
* Host can start the game, preventing others from signing up
* Realtime updates everywhere
